# The T.A.C.O. project
### Terraform & Ansible, Combined & Organized

## Purpose

The T.A.C.O. project is an Ansible toolkit aimed at making a standardized use of Terraform.

Var files management in Terraform does not fit my views on how it should be done.

## Prerequisites

Installed on the run host:

* Ansible 2.8.x
* Terraform 0.12.x
