# Frequently Asked Questions

## Why use Ansible instead of `$MY_PREFERED_TOOL` ?

For three simple reasons:

* Ansible makes it easy to open and hack the project if you want/need to.
* Ansible is great at mixing variables files and templating.
* On the project founder's workstation: `[ "$MY_PREFERED_TOOL" = "ansible" ]` returns `0`
