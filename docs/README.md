# The T.A.C.O. project
## Terraform and Ansible, Combined & Organized

### Where am I ?

This is the homepage of the T.A.C.O. project obviously.

This is an Ansible toolkit aimed at:
 
* making a standardized use of Terraform.
* adding before-and-after Ansible capabilities to any Terraform stack.
* bringing the full power of Ansible variables engine to feed Terraform stack. 

### Why use Ansible instead of `$MY_PREFERED_TOOL` ?

For three simple reasons:

* Ansible makes it easy to open and hack the project if you want/need to.
* Ansible is great at mixing variables files and templating.
* On the primary contributor's workstation: `$MY_PREFERED_TOOL == 'ansible'`

### What will you need on your workstation to use it ?

* A usable installation of Ansible
* A usable installation of Terraform
* The `make` CLI tool (optional)
